# Info
Yearly major theme driven CTF events build and organized by Team _localos_.

All events consisted of a qualifying ...

- usually up to seven days
- online
- free for all

... and one main event ...

- usually 18 to 24 hours
- onsite/offline
- sometimes hybrid (offline and online), so that teams (not) qualified were able to play, too
- onsite limited to 24 to 30 teams (we've changed venue several times to have more space for teams), max. four persons each
- drinks and food for free

...,  whereby each of them can be seen as a seperate event.

# Notes
Everytime some discussions are taking place in terms of prices. There is a reason why we do not	like high value prices, since it sucks and encourage people to fallback to neandertal behaviors, e.g. selfishness, ignorance, arrogance, and being unfair.

It is all about being nice to each other, have a good time, drink some beer and learn new stuff.

One more note in terms why the event is not listed at ctftime: Simply because our focus is not to get as much as possible participating teams. Instead we focus on our loyal community of returning teams. Nevertheless, the event is still open for everyone, we just do not announce it on ctftime.

Yeah, we know that the main logo is a bit crappy. Over the years we could have recreated it, but to be honest nobody of us really cares ;)
