# Info
Major theme driven CTF events build by Team localos.

All events consisted of a qualifying ...

- usually seven days
- online
- free for all

... and one main event ...

- usually 18 to 24 hours
- onsite/offline
- sometimes hybrid (offline and online), so that teams not qualified were able to play, too
- onsite limited to 24 to 30 teams, max. four persons each
- drinks and food for free

...,  whereby each of them can be seen as a seperate event.

# Important Note
There is a reason why we do not	like high value prices, since it sucks and encourage people to fallback to neandertal behaviors, e.g. selfishness, ignorance, arrogance, and being unfair.

It is all about being nice to each other, have a good time, drink some beer and learn new stuff.
