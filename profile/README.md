# About 

#### Who are we?
Not difficult to answer; just a bunch of people interested in different topics of computer science. Some of us are cyber-bullshit-bingo security enthusiasts, whereas others are e.g. more into mathematics ... in the end, all are somehow related to computer science and the underlying stuff.

#### What will you find here?
Almost nothing, besides some research related stuff and maybe some experiences in terms of organizing and setting up capture the flag events.

#### It is all about ~~cyber~~ right?
Last but not least, why are we using the bullshit prefix cyber in our CTFs instead of maybe commonly known format like `flag{...fill...some...bullsh_t...here}`? Yes, we do ... maybe. Why? Cause we can ... no, we think this term is characterized by the media and people who think they are the greatest. Ask ten different people for a definition and you'll get ten different ones.
So this is our statement what we think of this term.

**Apt quotation**
> "For IT security no one will pay, but for cyber security."
