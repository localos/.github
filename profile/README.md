# About 

### Who are we?
Not difficult to answer; just a bunch of loosely connected people interested in different topics of computer science. Some of us are cyber-bullshit-bingo security enthusiasts, whereas others are e.g. more into mathematics ... in the end, all are somehow related to computer science and the underlying stuff.

Currently we are a core team of about four/five people. Usually we get some help during crunch time just before a CTF event or other related deadlines.

### What will you find here?
Almost nothing, besides some research related stuff and maybe some experiences in terms of organizing and setting up capture the flag events.

### It is all about ~~cyber~~ right?
Last but not least, why are we using the bullshit prefix cyber in our CTFs instead of maybe commonly known formats like `flag{...fill...some...bullsh_t...here}`? Cause we can ... and, we think this term is characterized by the media and people who think they are the greatest. Ask ten different people for a definition and you'll get ten different ones.
So this is our statement what we think of this term without being abusive

# Capture the Flag
Challenges build for or solved of certain CTFs.

... stay tuned ...
