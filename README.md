# About 

### Who are we?
Not difficult to answer; just a bunch of loosely connected people interested in different topics of computer science. Some of us are cyber-bullshit-bingo security enthusiasts, whereas others are e.g. more into mathematics ... in the end, all are somehow related to computer science and the underlying stuff.

Team `localos` was founded around 2014 by [@solacol](https://github.com/solacol) to provide some kind of platform for mainly students interested in learning IT security.

We started with about four members, who are still forming the core:

- [@solacol](https://github.com/solacol)
- [@yurgiur](https://github.com/yurgiur)
- [@laoclos](https://github.com/laoclos)
- [@fiwufim](https://github.com/fiwufim)

Of course, we usually get some help during crunch time just before a CTF event or other related deadlines.

Most noteworthy helpers over the years:

- [@scoolal](https://github.com/scoolal)
- [@chrisbsd](https://github.com/chrisbsd/)
- [@lasolco](https://github.com/lasolco)
- [@afiaux](https://github.com/afiaux)

### What will you find here?
Almost nothing, besides some research related stuff and maybe some experiences in terms of organizing and setting up capture the flag events.

### It is all about ~~cyber~~, right?
Last but not least, why are we using the bullshit prefix cyber in our CTFs instead of maybe commonly known formats like `flag{...fill...some...bullsh_t...here}`? Cause we can ... and, we think this term is characterized by the media and people who think they are the greatest. Ask ten different people for a definition and you'll get ten different ones.
So this is our statement what we think of this term without being abusive.

# Capture the Flag
Usually we are focusing on building and organizing CTF events, so you might find some facts and challenges here.

### Marginalia
Some notes about stuff nobody is interested in, but who cares ;)

... stay tuned ...

### Eventinfo and Challenges
[Event information/stats](content/events) and [challenges build for](content/events) or [solved of](content/writeups) certain CTFs.
